# Strata Theme

The Strata theme is a responsive and minimal one-page-portfolio based on the self-named template made by [HTML5UP](//html5up.net/). Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are a custom about section, a portfolio with gallery for photographs or client works and a contact form.

This is a fork of the original hugo strata theme that [digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman) did.
